The array API implements a basic array for storing Objects. 
Its functionality allows a user to add elements, remove elements
search for elements, and in general perform any operations that
would be neccessary to allow easy access to the data of the array.

The array is not neccessarily of a set size. None of the functions
require that the array be either of variable or static size. Therefore
specific implementations of the API can restrict size or allow variable 
size arrays as they see fit.
